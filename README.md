# 🍒 Lychee

### The Orchestration Layer for Local LLMs — Built on Ollama

Lychee extends [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) with features the upstream doesn't have:
multi-model pipelines, structured output with auto-retry, persistent conversation memory,
and multi-instance load balancing. Everything Ollama does, Lychee does too — plus more.

## ⚡ What Lychee Adds (Original Features)

Lychee extends Ollama with advanced orchestration and developer utilities:

1. **Model Composer**
   Chain multiple local models together sequentially into multi-step pipelines. Pass outputs from one step as inputs to the next, using DAG-based conditional logic and routing.
2. **Structured Output with Auto-Retry**
   Go beyond basic JSON modes. Lychee validates output against a schema and automatically retries with error-correction prompting if the model produces invalid JSON.
3. **Conversation Memory Store**
   Persist chats locally (using SQLite and JSON). Save, list, resume, and delete conversations across sessions with simple API calls.
4. **Model Router with Load Balancing**
   Define virtual model names that route requests across multiple local or remote Ollama/Lychee instances using round-robin, random, or least-loaded strategies.
5. **Official Python & JS SDKs**
   Modern SDKs featuring first-class support for Model Composer, Structured Output, Memory, and Router configurations.

## 🤝 Inherited from Ollama (Full Credit)

The core engine and main capabilities are built directly on top of the excellent work by the Ollama team:
- **Core Inference Engine**: Powered by `llama.cpp` and Apple's MLX for high-performance GPU/CPU inference.
- **Universal API Layer**: OpenAI and Anthropic endpoint compatibility.
- **Stateful Agent Mode**: Embedded agent runtime with local tool execution and approval gates.
- **Model Registry & Management**: Seamlessly pull, run, and customize models.
- **Prompt Caching & KV Sharing**: Automated prefix hashing and KV cache management.

## 💡 Core Features Showcase

### 1. Direct HuggingFace Pull (`lychee hf`)
Search and download any GGUF format model directly from HuggingFace Hub with resume support, concurrent multi-shard downloads, and SHA256 integrity verification:
```bash
# Search catalog models
lychee hf search llama

# Download the recommended quantization of a HuggingFace model
lychee hf pull microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct-gguf

# List all available quantizations for a model repository
lychee hf pull bartowski/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF --list

# Download a specific quantization variant
lychee hf pull bartowski/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF --quant q5_k_m
```

### 2. Drop-in Anthropic SDK Support (`/v1/messages`)
Deploy Claude-compatible workflows locally. Point the official Anthropic client to Lychee:
```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(
    base_url="http://localhost:11434/v1",
    api_key="lychee-local"
)

message = client.messages.create(
    model="gemma3",
    max_tokens=1000,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in one sentence."}
    ]
)
print(message.content[0].text)
```

### 3. OpenAI Responses API (`/v1/responses`)
Generate structured data conforming to a JSON Schema directly from local models:
```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/responses \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gemma3",
    "prompt": "Extract information: Jane Doe is a 28-year-old engineer.",
    "response_format": {
      "type": "json_schema",
      "json_schema": {
        "name": "profile",
        "schema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "name": {"type": "string"},
            "age": {"type": "integer"},
            "occupation": {"type": "string"}
          },
          "required": ["name", "age", "occupation"]
        }
      }
    }
  }'
```

### 4. Interactive Agent Sandbox (`lychee run --experimental`)
Run LLM-driven agents with local tool support. Lychee prompts you with terminal UI approval before executing commands, searching the web, or accessing the filesystem:
```bash
# Start an interactive agent loop with bash, web search, and web fetch capabilities
lychee run gemma3 --experimental

# Inside the prompt, ask:
# >>> Search the web for latest Rust news and compile a list of highlights in rust_news.txt
#
# Lychee will prompt you in real time to approve/reject the web search and bash write actions!
```

### 5. Multi-Model Benchmarking & Comparison (`lychee compare`)
Evaluate multiple local models head-to-head on the same prompt with real-time, side-by-side streaming output and response metrics (tokens/sec, time-to-first-token):
```bash
# Compare gemma3 and phi3 side-by-side
lychee compare "Explain quantum computing in three sentences." gemma3 phi3
```

### 6. Interactive Terminal Performance Dashboard (`lychee stats --tui`)
Monitor active models, VRAM usage, token throughput, and model context usage in real time, directly from your shell, using a beautiful Bubbletea-powered terminal UI:
```bash
lychee stats --tui
```

### 7. Hardware Detection & Code Generation
Optimizing and integrating local models has never been simpler:
* **Hardware Scan (`lychee scan`)**: Scan your hardware configuration and receive personalized local model sizing and execution recommendations.
* **Code Boilerplate Generator (`lychee generate-client`)**: Generate ready-to-run, native API client code in Python, JavaScript, Rust, or Go for any loaded model.
